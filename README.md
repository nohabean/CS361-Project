# Recipe Calculator and Converter
This project was created as the portfolio project for CS361 (Software Engineering I) at Oregon State University. 
The project is a Recipe Calculator and Converter desktop application. It is written in python and uses PySide6 and PyQT 5 for the UI. The app utilizes microservice architecture. Users input values into the UI and then the client-side request is sent to the server in order to receive back the desired data (the response). This client/server interaction is handled using ZeroMQ. The development of the project followed a typical Agile development cycle.
